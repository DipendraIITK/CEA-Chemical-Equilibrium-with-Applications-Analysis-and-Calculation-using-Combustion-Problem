CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications) Analysis and Calculation using Combustion Problem
(Sep’23 – Oct’23)
– CEA Analysis was performed for assigned Enthalpy and Pressure
∗ Initial Temperature of reactants is 298K and at Atmospheric pressure
∗ Fuels considered are Jet A(L), Ethanol(L), Methanol(L) and Compositions of Jet A + 20
– Graphs are plotted for Flame temperature Vs Equivalence ratio and Mole fraction Vs Equivalence Ratio for
different fuels and their compositions
– Skills: NASA Equilibrium Computer Program - Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA)
